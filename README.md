Welcome to the **Visualization** module, an interactive tool designed to help visually impaired individuals better understand data structures and programming concepts through visual and tactile representations. This project is part of a larger effort to create accessible educational content for Python learners.

## About the Project

This module is part of a book I'm writing on Python, specifically tailored for visually impaired users. The goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive way to visualize common data structures like **lists**, **tuples**, **sets**, and more. The module uses simplified shapes and patterns to represent different elements, allowing users to "see" and interact with data in a new way.

### Example

The image below shows an example of how the **Visualization** module represents a list. Each element in the list is displayed as a distinct shape, making it easier to identify and understand the structure:

In this example:
- The list contains various elements such as numbers, strings, and objects.
- Each element is represented by a unique shape (e.g., arrows, triangles, circles) that corresponds to its type or value.
- Users can interact with the list by modifying it (e.g., popping elements) and seeing the changes reflected visually.

### Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Users can manipulate data structures like lists and see immediate visual feedback.
- **Customizable Shapes**: Different data types are represented by specific shapes, making it easier to distinguish between them.
- **Accessible Design**: Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that visually impaired users can engage with Python programming in an intuitive way.

## Installation

To install the module, simply clone this repository and run the following command:

```bash
pip install visualization
